                <abbr title="The Cafe"></abbr>
                <strong> The Cafe</strong> started as a dream in 2004, when envisioned creating a
                unique space where the community could come together over a great cup of coffee. With a passion for both
                coffee and creating a welcoming environment, set out to build a cafe that would be more
                than just a place to grab a quick drink‚Äîit would be a place where friendships are formed, ideas are
                shared, and everyone feels at home The journey began with a small team and a commitment to quality.
                We sourced our coffee beans from ensuring that every cup we serve reflects the dedication of the farmers
                who
                grewthem. Our menu, crafted with care, highlights both the simplicity of classic favorites and the
                creativity of seasonal specials, offering something for every palate.
                Thank you for being a part of our story. We hope to continue sharing many more cups of coffee with you!

                    <summary>Who invented the coffee ?</summary>
                    <p>The discovery of coffee is often attributed to a legendary figure named Kaldi, an Ethiopian goat
                        herder.
                        According to the story, Kaldi noticed that his goats became unusually energetic after eating the
                        red berries from a certain tree.
                        Curious, Kaldi tried the berries himself and experienced a similar boost in energy.

                        The legend goes on to say that Kaldi shared his discovery with a local monk,
                        who used the berries to make a drink that helped him stay awake during long hours of prayer.
                        Word of this energizing drink spread, and eventually, coffee made its way to the Arabian
                        Peninsula,
                        where it was cultivated and became a popular beverage.By the 15th century, coffee was being
                        grown in Yemen and enjoyed throughout the Islamic world.
                        It later spread to Europe and beyond, becoming the global phenomenon it is today.While this
                        story is a mix of myth and history,
                        it's widely regarded as the origin tale of coffee.The actual cultivation and use of coffee
                        likely began in the region of Ethiopia,
                        with the earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appearing
                        in the mid-15th century in the Sufi monasteries of Yemen.
